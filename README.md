## Project Description
This is my 8th project during the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

The app provides a list of vegan restaurants in Budapest (Hungary), and displays their location marker on a map generated by the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/). When a destination's name is clicked, an infoWindow displays more detailed information about the place.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
