## Project Description

This is my 8th project during the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

The app provides a list of our favorite places with my son in Budapest (Hungary), and displays their location marker on a map generated by the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/). When a destination's name is clicked, an infoWindow displays more detailed information about the place.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Dependencies & APIs used

* [`google-map-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-map-react)
* [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) - map
* [Foursquare Places API](https://developer.foursquare.com/places-api) - images, rating
